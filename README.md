This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust that causes undefined behavior. Specifically, the program manipulates a vector's raw pointer directly. This can lead to unexpected results or crashes because the vector's internal representation may be changed in ways that violate memory safety. The solution provides a safer approach using standard library functions that maintain the vector's internal consistency.
